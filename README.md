# U-Net
U-Net for Image Segmentation (TensorFlow/Keras) — A minimal, well-commented U-Net implementation for pixel-wise segmentation. The network follows the classic encoder–decoder (Conv–Conv–Pool → UpConv + skip connections) pattern and is set up for binary segmentation out of the box (e.g., plant vs. background). Easy to adapt for multi-class masks.
